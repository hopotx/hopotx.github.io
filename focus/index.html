      <h1>Lead Poisoning</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Lifelong consequences of exposure:</strong> Lead poisoning is a global health crisis, affecting every region of the world. High levels of exposure can be fatal, and even low levels of exposure cause neurological damage, especially in children. Lead in the body affects almost every major organ system, including the brain, liver, kidney, bones, blood, and reproductive systems. Adults with cumulative lead exposure from childhood have an increased risk of high blood pressure, kidney damage, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.</p>
<p><strong>A toxic metal in our environment:</strong> Lead is a naturally-occurring toxic metal, and has widespread uses by humans, making it a significant source of environmental contamination. It is found in paint from older homes, leaded drinking water pipes, aviation fuel, batteries, dust, ceramic glazes, spices, solder, jewelry, toys, and cosmetics, among other products. Roughly 60% of Americans alive today continue to endure the damaging impacts of childhood lead poisoning from their environment, which has manifested in lost IQ and ongoing risk of adverse health consequences.</p>
<p><strong>A health equity issue:</strong> The presence of lead in the environment is a longstanding example of health inequity. In the US, lead poses a significant risk to children living in older homes, and has been found to have a disproportionate impact on Black and Hispanic families in low-income communities. Globally, exposure to lead-contaminated soil and dust resulting from battery production, recycling, and mining has led to mass lead poisoning.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="pediatric-lead-poisoning">Pediatric Lead Poisoning</h2>
<p><strong>Our main focus: treating children poisoned by lead</strong> Children are particularly vulnerable to the dangerous effects of lead poisoning. When young children are exposed, they absorb 4-5 times more lead than adults, and can suffer profound and lifelong health impacts. Normal hand-to-mouth behavior results in children ingesting lead-containing dust or lead-coated objects, amplifying the impact of lead in the body. At low levels of exposure, lead can cause a spectrum of damage, including slowed brain development, reduced IQ, behavioral changes, reduced attention span, violent behavior. Lead can also cause anemia, hypertension, and damage to reproductive organs later in life.</p>
<p>There is no level of lead that is safe in the body. <em><strong>Levels as low as 1 µg/dL</strong></em> are associated with cognitive impairment, and the severity increases with exposure.</p>
<h2 id="lead-exposure-in-women">Lead exposure in women</h2>
<p>In adult women, lead takes on a particularly dangerous role. The body stores lead in bones, where it accumulates with ongoing exposure. During periods of bone decalcification, such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause, lead is released back into the bloodstream. During pregnancy, this directly exposes the developing fetus, putting both mother and child at risk for lead-related health complications and cognitive impacts.</p>
<p>Women entering menopause are at higher risk for damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver when bone decalcification releases lead from childhood exposure back into the bloodstream. People born between 1960-1980 in the US have almost a 100% chance of having had lead poisoning as children (link), and in women, this will re-emerge as a serious health threat during and after menopause.</p>
<h2 id="childhood-lead-poisoning">Childhood Lead Poisoning</h2>
<p>The consequences of lead (Pb) exposure during gestation and early childhood are both devastating and lifelong. Even <em><strong>low level exposure causes developmental disabilities</strong></em> such as hyperactivity, lower IQ, and attention deficits, as well as increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular disease later in life. <em><strong>Young children are particularly vulnerable</strong></em> to Pb exposure, as their growing bodies retain almost 500% more ingested Pb than adults. During pregnancy, Pb that has accumulated in the mother’s body can also be passed on to the developing child, <em><strong>placing them at risk and disadvantage even before birth</strong></em>. The available data show that the harm caused by Pb poisoning, particularly the neurological effects, cannot be undone. Thus, the only ways to <em><strong>minimize this lifelong damage are to remove Pb from a child’s body</strong></em> as quickly as possible, or more ideally to prevent its accumulation in the first place.</p>
<p>The societal and economic impact of Pb poisoning cannot be overstated. Exposed children are less likely to graduate high school and succeed by any available metric, and have a higher likelihood of juvenile delinquency, incarceration, and premature death. In the United States alone, the total economic cost of Pb poisoning is <em><strong>estimated at around $84 billion per year</strong></em>. Lower-income and minority communities make up the majority of the most severely affected areas, and <em><strong>the transgenerational impact of Pb poisoning</strong></em> only serves to further existing disparities in achievement, opportunities, and healthcare.</p>
<p>There is currently no treatment available for the overwhelming majority of children exposed to Pb. HOPO Therapeutics is developing its oral chelating agent as a best-in-class solution to this unmet need, and is committed to our vision of a world in which Pb poisoning is a treatable and passing diagnosis, rather than a life sentence for lower achievement and poorer health.

<h2 id="gadolinium-from-mri-contrast-agents">Gadolinium From MRI Contrast Agents</h2>
<p>There are over 15 million magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures performed in the United States each year that utilize an injected gadolinium-based contrast agent, or GBCA. The release of the toxic heavy metal gadolinium from these GBCAs <em>
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-warns-gadolinium-based-contrast-agents-gbcas-are-retained-body" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results in gadolinium deposition</a>
</em> throughout the body, and can lead to serious health complications. Currently there is no way to prevent or treat gadolinium deposition, and the diagnostic benefits of the contrast MRI are generally accepted to outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>In preclinical studies, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) enabled the <em>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22511-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective prevention of gadolinium deposition</a>
</em>. Our oral formulation enables the course of treatment we believe will be the most effective at preventing gadolinium deposition: a regimen of pills taken in the days following contrast MRI to ensure that gadolinium released into the body from the GBCA compound will be chelated and excreted from the body, instead of depositing in the kidneys, brain, and bones.</p>
<p>We are evaluating the efficacy of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) for removal of pre-existing, deposited gadolinium from patients who have already received GBCAs. The design of an effective dosing strategy requires a detailed knowledge of the compound&rsquo;s pharmacokinetics in humans - information we anticipate will be available following our first-in-human clinical trial.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>
<a href="https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Clinical-Resources/Contrast_Media.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The American College of Radiology advises against the use of GBCAs for patients with impaired kidney function</a>
</em> due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), making those individuals ineligible for MRI or MR angiography (MRA) with gadolinium-based contrast.  Instead, patients with kidney disease often undergo alternative imaging procedures using ionizing radiation, such as CT or PET. GBCAs are normally cleared from the body through the kidneys, however the primary excretion route of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) is via the liver. Using the compound to reduce the strain on the kidneys associated with clearing a large dose of GBCA could enable patients with kidney disease to undergo contrast MRI and MRA procedures, giving physicians ideal diagnostic information, and avoiding unnecessary exposure to radiation.
<br>

<h2 id="radiological-disaster-preparedness">Radiological Disaster Preparedness</h2>
<p>The oral formulation of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) has been designed to provide a safe, easily distributed, effective treatment in a large-scale radiological incident. Additionally, the excellent prophylactic efficacy observed in preclinical studies suggests that 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) can provide an effective means to protect first responders, nuclear workers, or other individuals entering a radiological contamination zone. Inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, the overhauling of the 
<a href="https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Strategic National Stockpile</a>
 will likely look to include next-generation treatments for a radiological or nuclear disaster scenario. HOPO Therapeutics is positioned to provide a best-in-class, uniquely orally-available treatment to both the US and foreign governments seeking to improve their strategic stockpile supplies.<em>
